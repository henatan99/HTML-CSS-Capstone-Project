  SASS and Bootstrap frameworks are used for the stylings of different sections and elements of the page. 
  Partial SCSS files are used for color, fonts, and @mixin collections
   - color partial SCSS file defines three color variables based on the client requirement 
   - Font partial SCSS files define 9 font sizes defined as ratios of the single variable font size. Seven font-weight variables are also defined. 
  The mixins partial SCSS element defines @mixin abstractions for custom fonts, custom boxes, custom buttons, and custom borders. Math and logic functions are employed to define some of the @mixin abstractions. 

  ### Cool features 
  This website design incorporates responsive typography by mathematically define all the font sizes in terms of few variables which can be easily manipulated, which simplifies maintenance and design flexibility greatly. 
  The design also has a dedicated partial SCSS file for slider background which gives the pages a descriptive and visually attractive element.
